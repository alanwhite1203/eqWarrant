# eqWarrant
An equity warrant is an option on the equity of a firm issued by the same firm, which gives the holder the right to purchase shares at a fixed price from the firm at a future date. When a warrant is exercised, the firm typically issues new shares at the exercise price to fill the order. The resulting increase in shares outstanding dilutes the share value.
